# ZEXALL
A Z80 Instruction Set Exerciser for CP/M-80

The ZEXDOC and ZEXALL programs by Frank D. Cringle are for testing
the documented (zexdoc.com) and all (zexall.com) instructions
respectively for the Z80 cpu.

They can be run on a real Zilog Z80 8-bit cpu or to verify operation
under an emulator.  Both binaries can be run under one of the
Digital Research's CP/M-80 operating systems (CP/M 2.2, CP/M 3 etc).

These programs (and their source-code in Z80 assembler) were extracted
from the final version of the YAZE-AG (Yet Another Z80 Emulator) version
2.51.1 curated by Andreas Gerlich at
